Operations of the Branch FU are implemented by the method branchInstruction().

"D" of latches: represents the instruction in the decode stage of the previous cycle

control Flow Instruction: means any of BNZ|BZ|JUMP|BAL|HALT

step1: move instructions

	if ("D" of latches is a control Flow Instruction)
           {  
	 	move "D" of latches to the branch stage of the current cycle   
    	   }
	else
    	  {
		add a NOP to the branch stage of the current cycle.
    	  }

step2: process branch instructions

    if ("D" of latches is a control Flow Instruction)
      {
	if instruction is BAL: special register is set to (current PC - 1)
	
	if instruction is BNZ: result of evaluation of instruction in the E2 stage of the         current cycle is stored in a temporary varaible dest .
	
	process branch instructions and calcualte updated PC
	if(currentPC is not equal to UpdatedPC)
	   {
            Update currentPC and current file pointer values.
	    set flag flushRegisterValues equal to true.
	   }

	if(flushRegisterValues = true)
	  {
		Add NOPs in the "F" and "D" of stages.
          }	
			   
      }

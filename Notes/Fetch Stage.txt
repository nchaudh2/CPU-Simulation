Fetch stage: implemented by the method fetchInstruction().

1) Instruction in the decode stage is checked for dependency(flow) with the    instruction in the Execute 1 stage.
   if any of the sources for this instruction are dependent on the destination of the          instruction in the E stage then a flag "isSourceValid" is set to false.

   if "isSourceValid"  is set to false:
         No new instruction is fetched in the pipeline.

   if "isSourceValid"  is set to True:
         1. A new instruction is fetched, currentFilePointer is incremented by 1, and
            currentPC is incrementd by 4 (to point to the next instruction).
	 2. instruction in the "F" of stages is moved to the "F" of latches and the newly                fetched instruction is Put in the "F" of stages

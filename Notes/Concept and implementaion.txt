Concept:

At any point in the project, whenever we start the execution of nth cycle, we maintain all the instructions in the (n-1)th stage in a Hashmap data-structure called Stages.
Data is stored in stages in a "Key" - "value" pair format as shown below:

stages

Key  Value
F    SUB R2 R2 R4
D    SUB R1 R1 R3
E    ADD R5 R5 R3
E2   STORE R6 R5 0
B1   NOP
Dly  NOP
M    NOP
W    NOP


Aditionally, we also maintain all the instructions in the (n-2)th stage in another Hashmap Data-strucure  called latches in "key" - "value" pair similar to stages. 

 
latches

key  value
F    SUB R1 R1 R3
D    ADD R5 R5 R3
E    STORE R6 R5 0
E2   NOP
B1   NOP
Dly  NOP
M    NOP
W    NOP

While processing for the nth cycle, instructions in stages is processed one by one by each stage. Finally, the data in stages represent the instructions in the nth cycle, which are then displayed on the console.

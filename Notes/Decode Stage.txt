if isSourceValid(set in the fetch stage) is false
   add NOP in the "D" of latches: this is done to ensure a NOP in the ALU1 stage of the    stages when we swap instruction later in the AlU1 stage

if isSourceValid = true
	1. process the instruction in the fetch stage of the latches and store it in latchs.            (check if valid data is present in the source registers for that instruction)
	2. moveInstruction("D", "F");
	   Move instruction in the "D" stage of stages to to the "D" stage of latches,
           and move instruction from the "F" stage of latches to the "D" stage of stages.
